# Renewable-Energy-Development-In-Egypt
The project aims to study the development of renewable energy in Egypt and the impact of economic changes on it.

This study investigates the development of renewable energy over years starting from 1990 till 2015
in Egypt, and the dynamic linkage between the development of renewable energy and the economic
situations. The data consists of 5 variables: renewable electricity output, renewable electricity share of total
electricity output, renewable energy consumption, GDP and inflation.

The following approaches are applied: cointegration, Granger-Causality and Vector Auto Regression to study the data as
multivariate time series. Vector Auto Regression is used to describe the dynamic behavior of the
variables.
